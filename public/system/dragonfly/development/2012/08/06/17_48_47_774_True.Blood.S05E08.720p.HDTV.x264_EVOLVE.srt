1
00:00:03,538 --> 00:00:04,972
I dug Russell up.

2
00:00:05,006 --> 00:00:07,942
<i>Russell Edgington was the</i>
<i>only vampire powerful enough</i>

3
00:00:07,977 --> 00:00:10,077
to take Roman Zimojic out.

4
00:00:10,112 --> 00:00:11,646
All you want is power.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,848
No. I want to share it.

6
00:00:13,883 --> 00:00:16,585
Only thing that matters
is what's in your heart right now.

7
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:19,421
Do you hate
Jessica Hamby?

8
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:20,389
I do.

9
00:00:20,423 --> 00:00:22,724
Who would want
to kill shifters?

10
00:00:22,758 --> 00:00:24,792
<i>Who even knows</i>
<i>about shifters?</i>

11
00:00:24,827 --> 00:00:26,828
You killed my friends.

12
00:00:28,297 --> 00:00:30,131
He was telling me
that there's this spirit

13
00:00:30,165 --> 00:00:33,067
<i>made of smoke</i>
<i>that's hunting him down.</i>

14
00:00:33,101 --> 00:00:34,903
Are you gonna be able
to live with yourself

15
00:00:34,937 --> 00:00:36,270
<i>if you give up on that man?</i>

16
00:00:36,305 --> 00:00:38,740
My <i>Jesusito,</i>
he had a gift.

17
00:00:38,774 --> 00:00:40,842
I will take back
what belongs to me.

18
00:00:44,513 --> 00:00:47,683
You take this, you grow up
to be big and strong.

19
00:00:47,717 --> 00:00:51,253
Emma?
I don't know you no more.

20
00:00:51,288 --> 00:00:53,422
<i>Being on V gives him</i>
<i>too much advantage.</i>

21
00:00:53,457 --> 00:00:55,925
I'm prepared to lose.

22
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:58,094
Your magic is finite.
You will run out

23
00:00:58,129 --> 00:00:59,829
<i>if you aren't careful</i>
<i>how much you use it.</i>

24
00:00:59,864 --> 00:01:03,065
- Would I be human?
- You would be fae no longer.

25
00:01:04,802 --> 00:01:08,004
This is the blood of Lilith.
Nothing could be less symbolic.

26
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:10,874
Tonight, everyone
will drink from her.

27
00:01:10,908 --> 00:01:13,610
I'm hungry!

28
00:01:18,917 --> 00:01:20,117
Lilith.

29
00:01:37,968 --> 00:01:39,535
Enjoy prison, asshole.

30
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,704
You think this
is all gonna stop?

31
00:01:41,738 --> 00:01:44,340
There's a hundred
of me out there, shifter.

32
00:01:44,374 --> 00:01:46,575
A thousand.
So sleep tight.

33
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,011
Shut up, butt plug.

34
00:01:51,781 --> 00:01:54,583
Evening,
Mr. Merlotte.

35
00:01:54,617 --> 00:01:58,320
They're everywhere.
At my house, in the hospital.

36
00:01:58,388 --> 00:02:00,822
- Hey, shh.
- Goddamn maniacs.

37
00:02:00,857 --> 00:02:02,324
Deep breath.

38
00:02:02,358 --> 00:02:04,259
All right?
One's off to jail.

39
00:02:04,293 --> 00:02:05,961
Andy'll track
down the rest.

40
00:02:05,995 --> 00:02:07,762
- We are being hunted.
- Take-- take it easy.

41
00:02:07,797 --> 00:02:08,600
I'm not gonna take--

42
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:10,625
There's a deputy right
outside your door.

43
00:02:10,733 --> 00:02:12,999
We should start picking off these
moonshine-drinking rednecks

44
00:02:13,034 --> 00:02:14,401
one by one.
See how they fucking like it.

45
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:16,836
Okay, okay.
That's not gonna solve anything.

46
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:18,471
We should get rid of them
before they get rid of us.

47
00:02:18,506 --> 00:02:20,674
- You need to rest.
- Just--

48
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:22,509
Luna, hey.
All right?

49
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:23,610
- I promise you--
- Okay.

50
00:02:23,645 --> 00:02:25,479
Come on, shh.

51
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:29,015
I promise-- I promise
you'll feel better.

52
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,317
- Okay.
- All right.

53
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:33,319
- Okay.
- Okay? All right.

54
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:36,088
Hey, listen.

55
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:37,989
I'm on this.

56
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:39,892
I'm headed to
the station right now.

57
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:43,695
Okay.

58
00:02:54,637 --> 00:02:56,737
- Night, Mr. Merlotte.
- Night, Kevin.

59
00:02:56,772 --> 00:02:59,306
<i>Keep an eye on her.</i>

60
00:02:59,341 --> 00:03:00,841
This is fucking ridiculous.

61
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:03,076
Do nothing.

62
00:03:03,111 --> 00:03:04,278
Stay in your room.

63
00:03:04,312 --> 00:03:05,712
Be helpless.

64
00:03:36,238 --> 00:03:39,016
Fuck me.

65

What the hell
just happened?

84
00:05:55,801 --> 00:05:58,770
We saw her.

85
00:05:58,804 --> 00:06:01,306
She appeared to us.
We saw Lilith.

86
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,775
Yeah, I saw something.

87
00:06:03,809 --> 00:06:06,111
We were in
the presence of God.

88
00:06:06,145 --> 00:06:09,314
We were high
as fucking kites.

89
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,458
Get out of me!

90
00:06:18,493 --> 00:06:20,126
Get out!

91
00:06:24,731 --> 00:06:26,232
Hey! Hey!

92
00:06:26,267 --> 00:06:29,235
Jason!

93
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,438
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

94
00:06:31,472 --> 00:06:33,006
You got me in the head.

95
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,675
What the hell's happening?

96
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,444
It's like
a thunderstorm out here.

97
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:38,046
I'm dumping
all my fairy light.

98
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,181
- Why would you wanna do that?
- Because I'm tired.

99
00:06:40,215 --> 00:06:41,682
I'm tired
of hearing voices,

100
00:06:41,717 --> 00:06:43,185
I'm tired of being
chased by vampires,

101
00:06:43,219 --> 00:06:44,887
and I'm tired
of being a freak.

102
00:06:44,921 --> 00:06:47,423
Hey.

103
00:06:47,457 --> 00:06:50,226
- You are not a freak.
- That's easy for you to say.

104
00:06:50,261 --> 00:06:52,429
You don't know what it's like
to be standing in line

105
00:06:52,463 --> 00:06:54,130
at the bank and hear
the guy behind you

106
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:55,865
thinking about how
he wants to suck your toes.

107
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,634
Ew.
That happened?

108
00:06:57,669 --> 00:07:00,637
You don't know what it's like to have
your parents' death on your hands

109
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:02,205
just because
of what you are.

110
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:06,308
- I wanna be normal.
- The hell you do.

111
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:09,378
Look, if you were normal,

112
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:12,648
you never woulda met Bill.

113
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:14,317
Yeah, big loss there.

114
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,386
Now, I know you two
had your ups and downs,

115
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,187
but you loved him.

116
00:07:19,423 --> 00:07:21,357
Real love.

117
00:07:23,227 --> 00:07:25,729
And that's something
not everyone gets.

118
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,501
And talking to Gran
on the other side,

119
00:07:32,905 --> 00:07:36,974
hearing her voice
one last time?

120
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:41,179
That don't happen
to normal folk.

121
00:07:43,316 --> 00:07:45,516
You're right.

122
00:07:47,887 --> 00:07:50,589
And I'll tell
you something else.

123
00:07:50,623 --> 00:07:52,524
You are who you are

124
00:07:52,558 --> 00:07:54,625
'cause you got
Mama and Daddy

125
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,627
inside of you.

126
00:07:57,596 --> 00:07:59,229
And you wanna
get rid of that

127
00:07:59,264 --> 00:08:01,866
to feel normal?

128
00:08:04,103 --> 00:08:06,604
And even if you did
un-fairy yourself,

129
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,307
it ain't ever gonna
feel right until we find out

130
00:08:08,341 --> 00:08:09,942
who killed our parents.

131
00:08:11,712 --> 00:08:13,246
And that thing
that you have in you,

132
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,482
your special power,

133
00:08:15,516 --> 00:08:18,985
that could be the one thing
that could help us.

134
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:22,255
So please, don't be spraying
it all over the yard.

135
00:08:28,496 --> 00:08:30,898
Hey, that thing at the bank
really happened?

136
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,901
It was Mike Spencer.

137
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:37,071
Ew.

138
00:09:00,563 --> 00:09:02,097
Mr. Merlotte?

139
00:09:02,131 --> 00:09:05,233
- How did you--
- Mind your own goddamn business!

140
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,843
I seen you.

141
00:09:51,214 --> 00:09:53,983
You know,
they say my blood

142
00:09:54,017 --> 00:09:56,319
is like a goddamn
milkshake.

143
00:09:57,454 --> 00:09:59,889
You don't even need
no straw.

144
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,781
We witnessed
a miracle tonight.

145
00:10:22,815 --> 00:10:24,283
We saw God

146
00:10:24,317 --> 00:10:27,352
- and She smiled upon us.
- Unbelievable.

147
00:10:27,386 --> 00:10:28,820
I mean, I have never--

148
00:10:28,855 --> 00:10:32,223
The most beautiful thing
I've ever seen

149
00:10:32,258 --> 00:10:34,859
in 500 years.

150
00:10:34,894 --> 00:10:38,429
I never truly believed
until now.

151
00:10:38,497 --> 00:10:39,864
First, may I say

152
00:10:39,898 --> 00:10:44,335
God has the most beautiful
tits I've ever seen.

153
00:10:45,805 --> 00:10:49,240
Now, I have never
been called devout,

154
00:10:49,275 --> 00:10:53,345
but watching Lilith
shoot out of a blood pool

155
00:10:53,379 --> 00:10:56,048
while I sucked down a bride

156
00:10:56,082 --> 00:10:59,285
to the dulcet strains
of "You Light Up My Life",

157
00:10:59,319 --> 00:11:02,989
well, praise Lilith,
praise Jesus,

158
00:11:03,023 --> 00:11:06,559
praise Moses's cock!
I am born again!

159
00:11:07,661 --> 00:11:10,597
Amen. Me, too.

160
00:11:12,366 --> 00:11:14,100
For the first time
in a decade,

161
00:11:14,135 --> 00:11:16,302
I ate a child.

162
00:11:16,337 --> 00:11:20,373
I took his life inside
of me and it was ripe.

163
00:11:20,407 --> 00:11:22,708
- Yes.
- This was a sign.

164
00:11:22,743 --> 00:11:25,011
<i>Roman's death has been</i>
<i>sanctioned by God</i>

165
00:11:25,045 --> 00:11:27,780
and we're on
the correct path.

166
00:11:27,815 --> 00:11:29,682
Yes.

167
00:11:29,716 --> 00:11:34,487
And now we can move forward
with a clear conscience.

168
00:11:35,656 --> 00:11:38,425
But we have
a lot of work to do

169
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,460
and we will need food.

170
00:11:40,495 --> 00:11:42,863
So, Steve, please
have the guards procure

171
00:11:42,897 --> 00:11:44,765
<i>a few dozen humans</i>
<i>before daybreak.</i>

172
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:47,467
Just put them
in the holding cells.

173
00:11:47,502 --> 00:11:49,035
<i>I need a baby.</i>

174
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:51,538
Lilith wants me
to eat a baby.

175
00:11:51,572 --> 00:11:53,708
And a baby for Nigel.

176
00:11:53,742 --> 00:11:55,977
Coming right up.

177
00:11:59,148 --> 00:12:01,416
Well, I think I've had
enough fun for one night.

178
00:12:05,221 --> 00:12:06,822
Are you coming?

179
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,542
You know this doesn't mean
I'm your girlfriend.

180
00:13:37,711 --> 00:13:39,979
I don't remember asking.

181
00:13:50,025 --> 00:13:52,493
You wanna be
my girlfriend?

182
00:13:53,929 --> 00:13:56,796
Maybe.

183
00:14:11,043 --> 00:14:13,045
You rang?

184
00:14:14,614 --> 00:14:17,416
I thought you might wanna join me
for a late-night snack.

185
00:14:18,918 --> 00:14:20,452
Please don't do this.

186
00:14:20,486 --> 00:14:22,621
I have a four-month-old
daughter. Please.

187
00:14:24,757 --> 00:14:27,825
Thank you, but, um,
I'm not hungry.

188
00:14:27,859 --> 00:14:29,860
Who are you

189
00:14:29,895 --> 00:14:32,529
to refute
God's plan?

190
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,936
Feed on this woman
as Lilith has commanded.

191
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:41,406
No! Please, no.
You can't do this.

192
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,708
Did you think the club
was an anomaly?

193
00:14:43,743 --> 00:14:45,207
That we would stop
after one night?

194
00:14:45,232 --> 00:14:46,178
No.

195
00:14:46,179 --> 00:14:50,415
That we would starve
ourselves on Tru Blood?

196
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:55,219
- Is that what you thought?
- I will not be bullied.

197
00:14:55,253 --> 00:14:59,023
Understand this.
I have fathered children.

198
00:14:59,057 --> 00:15:00,724
I cannot take this woman
away from--

199
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:04,428
If you really loved
your human children,

200
00:15:04,463 --> 00:15:06,264
why didn't you make
them vampire?

201
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:10,235
Keep them
with you forever?

202
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:11,836
Please.
God, no.

203
00:15:16,175 --> 00:15:18,544
<i>Miss Sarah, someone's</i>
<i>here to see you.</i>

204
00:15:26,886 --> 00:15:29,722
- Father?
- My angel.

205
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:33,125
Am I in heaven?

206
00:15:33,993 --> 00:15:36,628
No.

207
00:15:37,964 --> 00:15:41,032
But your face.

208
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:44,769
- You're so--
- I appear as you knew me

209
00:15:46,438 --> 00:15:49,808
when you were a child.

210
00:15:49,842 --> 00:15:51,943
So young.

211
00:15:51,977 --> 00:15:55,313
It's not possible.

212
00:15:57,082 --> 00:16:00,018
I have missed you

213
00:16:00,052 --> 00:16:02,620
every hour of every day.

214
00:16:07,894 --> 00:16:10,229
But how?

215
00:16:12,866 --> 00:16:16,669
I have been shown how
to live longer

216
00:16:16,703 --> 00:16:19,005
than most ever
thought possible.

217
00:16:20,674 --> 00:16:23,443
Make me like you, then.

218
00:16:23,478 --> 00:16:25,945
My angel, I cannot.

219
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,047
I don't wanna die.

220
00:16:28,082 --> 00:16:30,116
- Sarah--
- Please.

221
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,986
I want to live.

222
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:36,522
- No.
- Why?

223
00:16:36,557 --> 00:16:40,059
Immortality is a curse.

224
00:16:40,093 --> 00:16:43,128
I can feel myself rotting.

225
00:16:44,398 --> 00:16:47,433
No.

226
00:16:47,468 --> 00:16:49,135
Please.

227
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,438
Please.

228
00:16:52,472 --> 00:16:53,506
Please!

229
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,508

Just shut up!

To refuse
God's gift to us

237
00:17:19,033 --> 00:17:20,667
is blasphemy.

No!

00:18:20,431 --> 00:18:21,898
Where the hell are we?

243
00:18:21,932 --> 00:18:24,000
It took us forever

244
00:18:24,034 --> 00:18:24,935
We're home, brother.

245

- Mm-hmm.
- All right.

246
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:35,678

<i>Hoyt, this is</i>
<i>a big night for you.</i>

Something to officially
welcome you to the group.

250
00:18:46,991 --> 00:18:49,693
Hey, don't look her
in the fucking eyes, y'all. Shit.

251
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:52,095
Dipshit, this ain't
our first vamper.

252
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,964
Picked her up
just for you.

253
00:18:53,998 --> 00:18:55,733
- Hoyt?
- You know how you was telling us

254
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,201
how she broke your heart?

255
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:59,938
Partly your own fault
for dating fucking death incarnate.

256
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,939
Yeah, well,
we got to talking.

257
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,142
We decided, instead of staking
the bitch ourselves,

258
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:06,744
we was gonna let you do it.

259
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:10,080
Yeah, give her some real payback
for the pain she done caused you.

260
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:12,115
You hear that, Ruby Red?

261
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:16,553
Your ex-boyfriend's gonna
stick it in you one last time.

262
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:18,722
And I mean the stake,
not your johnson.

263
00:19:18,756 --> 00:19:21,725
- Yeah, I understand.
- Oh, no stake tonight.

264
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:29,233
You got six shots,
all wooden with a silver core.

265
00:19:29,267 --> 00:19:31,001
Whoa.

266
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:33,204
Yeah.

267
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:34,802
Looking at her, though,
it looks like you're only

268
00:19:34,827 --> 00:19:36,474
gonna probably need one.

269
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:45,416
Hey.

270
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,252
Don't get cold feet.

271
00:19:48,286 --> 00:19:50,821
It ain't murder.
She's already fucking dead.

272
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,723
- I know.
- Hoyt--

273
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:55,827
<i>Shut up! She done caused</i>
<i>you a world of hurt.</i>

274
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,362
Not to mention
she's a fucking freak of nature.

275
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:00,231
- You!
- Yeah, I know.

276
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:02,099
You fucking hate
her dead guts, right?

277
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:05,202
- You said so.
- Yeah, it's just-- it's just--

278
00:20:07,772 --> 00:20:09,973
All right, all right,
all right. All right, listen here.

279
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,811
Listen here.

280
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:16,413
Now, you need
to do this, brother.

281
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:18,615
It's gonna feel good.

282
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,483
It's gonna help you heal.

283
00:20:25,756 --> 00:20:27,957
Hey.

284
00:20:32,963 --> 00:20:35,031
<i>Now...</i>

285
00:20:37,969 --> 00:20:40,370
I'm gonna lock this door

286
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,540
and it ain't opening
till you finish her.

287
00:20:55,549 --> 00:20:58,450
Are you absolutely sure
you want to go down this path?

288
00:20:58,484 --> 00:21:01,386
I didn't even know this path
existed until you told me.

289
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,855
"You have powers
you've never even dreamed of."

290
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:07,524
So do I?
Or was that all just bull-hockey?

291
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,393
<i>Look, we just want</i>
<i>to find the son of a bitch</i>

292
00:21:09,427 --> 00:21:11,095
that killed our parents.

293
00:21:11,129 --> 00:21:13,864
So if my sister has secret powers
that can help us,

294
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:15,698
y'all had better speak up.

295
00:21:20,837 --> 00:21:22,771
Hey, do you have any idea
what it feels like

296
00:21:22,805 --> 00:21:24,272
to find out that
your parents were murdered

297
00:21:24,306 --> 00:21:26,974
by a freaking vampire?

298
00:21:30,879 --> 00:21:33,580
You cannot come in here,
start screaming about vampires,

299
00:21:33,614 --> 00:21:35,681
and just expect me
to help you.

300
00:21:35,716 --> 00:21:37,316
When our kind
came to this plane,

301
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:39,785
we swore not to involve
ourselves in such matters.

302
00:21:39,819 --> 00:21:41,420
- I know how we can help.
- Claudette.

303
00:21:41,454 --> 00:21:43,655
- Well, I do.
- Shh. Listen.

304
00:21:43,689 --> 00:21:46,590
I care about
the two of you, okay?

305
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:50,093
Our families have a bond.
We have a bond.

306
00:21:50,127 --> 00:21:52,762
I don't know who killed
your parents,

307
00:21:52,796 --> 00:21:56,765
but there may be a way
we can find out.

308
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,701
- How?
- Meet me at the bridge

309
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:00,669
where your parents were
murdered at noon.

310
00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:46,943
Jesus.

311
00:23:23,614 --> 00:23:27,016
- Thanks.
- For what?

312
00:23:28,218 --> 00:23:30,986
Are you fucking real?

313
00:23:32,155 --> 00:23:34,256
Does it matter?

314
00:23:52,509 --> 00:23:54,243
I know you got friends.

315
00:23:54,278 --> 00:23:55,978
Dipshits like you
grow in bunches.

316
00:23:56,013 --> 00:23:57,880
Oh, it's just me,
Officer.

317
00:23:57,915 --> 00:23:59,882
One man doing his best
to save America.

318
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:01,984
Save America?
From what?

319
00:24:02,019 --> 00:24:04,554
Freaks.

320
00:24:09,593 --> 00:24:11,260
Now listen here,
fuckstick.

321
00:24:11,294 --> 00:24:13,462
I been hauling your ass
in here since high school,

322
00:24:13,497 --> 00:24:16,065
but this time you're gonna go
to prison till the goddamn Rapture

323
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,400
unless you start talking.

324
00:24:17,434 --> 00:24:20,069
I want names.
I want addresses.

325
00:24:20,104 --> 00:24:21,438
And if I don't get 'em,

326
00:24:21,472 --> 00:24:24,108
my Taser's gonna ask
your nuts to the big dance.

327
00:24:24,142 --> 00:24:26,043
Fuck you, shifter-lover.

328
00:24:26,077 --> 00:24:27,477
- Asshole.
- Andy--

329
00:24:27,512 --> 00:24:29,313
Shut up, Merlotte.
I said you could observe.

330
00:24:29,347 --> 00:24:31,582
Andy, hey.

331
00:24:31,616 --> 00:24:33,617
Could I have a minute alone
with our friend here?

332
00:24:33,652 --> 00:24:37,021
I have certain techniques.

333
00:24:37,055 --> 00:24:38,922
Might help get us answers.

334
00:24:41,993 --> 00:24:43,728
<i>It's against the law.</i>

335
00:24:47,466 --> 00:24:49,767
I'm gonna go
get a cup of coffee.

336
00:24:50,803 --> 00:24:54,007
Might be a while
before I get back.

337
00:24:57,179 --> 00:24:59,981
It's just a matter
of time, freak.

338
00:25:00,015 --> 00:25:01,916
Bang.

339
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,218
That's funny

340
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:07,889
'cause I was thinking
the same thing.

341
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:10,624
Whoa, whoa.
What the hell?

342
00:25:10,659 --> 00:25:12,226
I ain't no fucking homo.

343
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:13,695
Neither am I.

344
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,167
Shit.

345
00:25:18,201 --> 00:25:20,203
Fuck.

346
00:25:22,773 --> 00:25:24,774
Shit.

347
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:27,977
Sheriff!

348
00:25:28,012 --> 00:25:29,812
What the monkey spunk?

349
00:25:29,847 --> 00:25:32,982
Where's that son of a bitch
who tried to kill me?

350
00:25:33,016 --> 00:25:34,984
- What?
- Is Sam here?

351
00:25:35,018 --> 00:25:36,952
I mean, have you seen me?

352
00:25:36,987 --> 00:25:38,820
Are you shitting me,
Merlotte?

353
00:25:38,855 --> 00:25:40,455
- They hurt?
- I don't know.

354
00:25:41,724 --> 00:25:43,525
Andy, they got Jessica Hamby.

355
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:46,194
I got the address--
oh, sweet Jesus.

356
00:25:46,228 --> 00:25:48,495
Holy shit.
What the hell happened?

357
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:50,163
How the fuck should I know?

358
00:25:50,198 --> 00:25:53,666
I was in my room and the
next thing I know, I'm you.

359
00:25:53,701 --> 00:25:55,235
Jesus Christ.

360
00:25:55,269 --> 00:25:58,171
All right, easy.
It's okay.

361
00:25:58,205 --> 00:25:59,939
Okay?
I am fucked.

362
00:25:59,974 --> 00:26:01,807
When I shift back--

363
00:26:01,842 --> 00:26:02,561
Can you shift back?

364
00:26:02,586 --> 00:26:04,586
Don't you think I fucking
tried that already?

365
00:26:05,879 --> 00:26:08,280
- I'm gonna die, Sam.
- No, you're not gonna die.

366
00:26:08,315 --> 00:26:10,783
- You'll be okay.
- No, I won't.

367
00:26:10,817 --> 00:26:12,585
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, fuck.

368
00:26:12,619 --> 00:26:14,453
Fuck. Fuck.

369
00:26:14,487 --> 00:26:17,489
I hate this goddamn town.

370
00:26:17,524 --> 00:26:20,860
So, Sookie, there is
absolutely no guarantee

371
00:26:20,894 --> 00:26:22,562
that what we're about
to try will work.

372
00:26:22,596 --> 00:26:24,197
What are we about to try?

373
00:26:24,231 --> 00:26:26,032
Everything is made of energy.

374
00:26:26,067 --> 00:26:26,782
<i>Albert Einstein--</i>

375
00:26:26,807 --> 00:26:28,807
Who was a halfling
just like you, Sookie.

376
00:26:28,836 --> 00:26:31,471
<i>--explained this to your kind</i>
<i>with his E equals MC squared.</i>

377
00:26:31,505 --> 00:26:33,472
Matter is simply
frozen energy.

378
00:26:33,506 --> 00:26:35,472
And this energy
permeates everything.

379
00:26:35,506 --> 00:26:36,873
So when something happens...

380
00:26:36,907 --> 00:26:38,774
For instance,
when a woman gives birth.

381
00:26:38,808 --> 00:26:41,476
...it sends ripples through the
energy that never completely die.

382
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:44,212
They can be accessed by someone
who has a connection to them.

383
00:26:44,246 --> 00:26:46,514
So there's a way
to access the ripples

384
00:26:46,548 --> 00:26:48,815
to see
into the past?

385
00:26:48,849 --> 00:26:50,283
Fairies have
this ability, yes.

386
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,351
Well, ain't you glad
you didn't get rid of your light?

387
00:26:52,385 --> 00:26:54,586
And since your strongest
connection is with your mother,

388
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,288
you'll try and inhabit
her memory.

389
00:26:56,322 --> 00:26:58,923
- In essence, become her.
- Experience what she experienced,

390
00:26:58,957 --> 00:27:01,925
- through her eyes.
- Here, where it occurred.

391
00:27:02,927 --> 00:27:04,260
Perhaps you'll learn
the identity

392
00:27:04,294 --> 00:27:06,194
of the vampire
that you seek.

393
00:27:07,594 --> 00:27:09,162
My sisters and I will help
amplify the signal.

394
00:27:09,196 --> 00:27:10,863
Join hands.

395
00:27:14,768 --> 00:27:16,202
Okay, I want you
to concentrate, Sookie,

396
00:27:16,236 --> 00:27:17,869
as though you're
reading thoughts.

397
00:27:17,904 --> 00:27:20,071
Just let it come.

398
00:27:26,246 --> 00:27:29,581
Oh, my God.
I can smell Mama's perfume.

399
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:34,818
Jason, I can feel her.

400
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:36,653
Are you kidding?

401
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:38,321
It's incredible.

402
00:27:49,065 --> 00:27:51,599
<i>- Corbett, no! No!</i>
- What do you want?

403
00:27:51,634 --> 00:27:53,100
Wait. Wait.

404
00:27:53,135 --> 00:27:54,935
Come here!

405
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:57,037
- Help me! No!
- <i>Get off of him!</i>

406
00:28:02,343 --> 00:28:04,210
<i>No, we have children!</i>
<i>Please!</i>

407
00:28:06,747 --> 00:28:09,250
It smells
so good in here.

408
00:28:11,587 --> 00:28:15,255
"It smells so good."

409
00:28:40,915 --> 00:28:45,019
Stop! Warlow,
leave the girl alone!

410
00:28:47,088 --> 00:28:49,656
- Sook?
- Sookie?

411
00:28:54,195 --> 00:28:55,730
Hoyt?

412
00:28:57,833 --> 00:28:59,601
Please.

413
00:29:01,604 --> 00:29:03,639
T-take the silver off.

414
00:29:07,676 --> 00:29:11,212
Ray's right.
You're already dead.

415
00:29:11,245 --> 00:29:14,080
Shooting you
wouldn't be murder.

416
00:29:14,115 --> 00:29:16,649
You fucked
my best friend.

417
00:29:16,683 --> 00:29:18,918
<i>You sucked his dick.</i>

418
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,955
You broke
my goddamn heart.

419
00:29:29,763 --> 00:29:31,697
And I fucking loved you.

420
00:29:33,133 --> 00:29:34,700
I know you did.

421
00:29:35,769 --> 00:29:38,538
So why don't you
love me anymore?

422
00:29:47,783 --> 00:29:50,052
I wanted to love you.

423
00:29:52,489 --> 00:29:56,392
I even prayed
for it to come back.

424
00:29:58,695 --> 00:30:00,229
It just didn't.

425
00:30:00,264 --> 00:30:02,131
It ain't never gonna.

426
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:04,667
I'm sorry.

427
00:30:15,012 --> 00:30:17,982
It tries to tear him apart--

428
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:22,552
- You did it?
- Where are the other boys?

429
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:24,754
They ain't here.

430
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:26,789
There's your
fucking milkshake.

431
00:30:26,824 --> 00:30:28,525
All right.
Let's go.

432
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,693
Wait, I can't.
It's daytime.

433
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:33,096
Oh, shit.

434
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:34,499
Well, I got no phone.

435
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:37,670
We're a hundred miles
in the middle of nowhere.

436
00:30:38,906 --> 00:30:42,342
- I'll send help.
- Okay. Hey, Hoyt?

437
00:30:44,512 --> 00:30:46,180
Thank you.

438
00:30:47,081 --> 00:30:50,084
Fuck you, Jess.

439
00:31:02,097 --> 00:31:03,732
Lafayette, thank God.

440
00:31:03,766 --> 00:31:06,471
Unless y'all are here to tell me
I done goddamn won the lottery,

441
00:31:06,506 --> 00:31:09,541
- get out my face.
- We need your help.

442
00:31:09,575 --> 00:31:11,576
Hooker, I ain't in
the helping business no more.

443
00:31:11,611 --> 00:31:13,745
I'm in the "fuck off
while I smoke a blunt" business

444
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:16,815
and business is about
to pick way the fuck up.

445
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,851
Lafayette, it's Terry.

446
00:31:18,885 --> 00:31:21,553
I don't know if he's off his meds
or if he's just gone crazy,

447
00:31:21,587 --> 00:31:24,957
but he thinks a woman
he killed in Iraq has cursed him.

448
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:27,459
Uh, tell him about
the fire monster.

449
00:31:27,493 --> 00:31:31,162
Oh, also, he thinks a demon
made of fire is hunting him.

450
00:31:31,197 --> 00:31:33,565
He off his meds.
<i>Ciao,</i> bitches.

451
00:31:34,734 --> 00:31:36,769
Lafayette, please.
You and I both know

452
00:31:36,803 --> 00:31:38,270
that there are things
in this world

453
00:31:38,305 --> 00:31:40,906
that are beyond
explanation.

454
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:42,575
And even if
it isn't real

455
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,077
and Terry
is off his meds,

456
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:45,745
he still believes
it's true.

457
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:48,247
So what the fuck do
y'all want me to do?

458
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:51,318
Convince him
it's not true.

459
00:31:51,352 --> 00:31:53,654
You're a medium.
Terry knows that.

460
00:31:53,688 --> 00:31:56,056
<i>So, we all sit down,</i>

461
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:58,091
you try and make contact
with this woman's spirit,

462
00:31:58,126 --> 00:32:01,094
and then you tell him
she's agreed to lift the curse.

463
00:32:01,129 --> 00:32:02,529
If we can convince Terry

464
00:32:02,563 --> 00:32:05,298
that her spirit
has called off the demon,

465
00:32:05,332 --> 00:32:08,134
then it won't matter one lick
if it's all mumbo jumbo.

466
00:32:08,168 --> 00:32:11,470
He'll be at peace.
And I can have my family back.

467
00:32:17,277 --> 00:32:19,312
Look here.

468
00:32:19,347 --> 00:32:21,548
I'm sick and tired
of doing this shit for free.

469
00:32:21,582 --> 00:32:25,219
So if you wants my help,
you gots to pay for it.

470
00:32:25,253 --> 00:32:27,788
- Are you serious?
- Mm.

471
00:32:29,057 --> 00:32:31,458
Okay. 50 bucks.

472
00:32:31,493 --> 00:32:32,993
300.

473
00:32:33,028 --> 00:32:34,795
I'm about to slip
my ass in this tub

474
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,430
and get high
as a motherfucker.

475
00:32:36,464 --> 00:32:38,565
Enjoys your day.

476
00:32:48,543 --> 00:32:50,744
- Oh, my God. Jessica.
- Sam.

477
00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:53,247
- Sam?
- That's his girlfriend.

478
00:32:53,281 --> 00:32:55,049
She turned into him.
Now she's stuck.

479
00:32:55,083 --> 00:32:56,450
She turned into
what?

480
00:32:56,484 --> 00:32:58,118
Uh, never mind.
Who the hell's this?

481
00:32:58,152 --> 00:33:00,654
Oh, uh, Reggie.
He's dead.

482
00:33:00,688 --> 00:33:02,789
- Where's Hoyt?
- He's not with you?

483
00:33:02,823 --> 00:33:04,891
- No. Are you okay?
- Wait, wait. Hoyt left.

484
00:33:04,925 --> 00:33:06,426
He said he was
going to get help.

485
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,828
- Do you smell that?
- Yeah.

486
00:33:07,862 --> 00:33:10,131
<i>- What?</i>
- Was there a woman here?

487
00:33:10,165 --> 00:33:12,300
- A human woman.
- No, just guys.

488
00:33:12,335 --> 00:33:14,536
- Wait-- which one of you is Sam?
- I am.

489
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:17,439
<i>Well, there was</i>
<i>a woman here.</i>

490
00:33:17,473 --> 00:33:20,909
And she's a big one.

491
00:33:20,944 --> 00:33:22,244
Lousy diet,

492
00:33:22,278 --> 00:33:25,481
<i>a lot of Cheetos,</i>
<i>Mello Yello.</i>

493
00:33:25,515 --> 00:33:29,084
Smoker, too.
Menthols.

494
00:33:33,723 --> 00:33:35,389
- Oh, my God.
- What?

495
00:33:35,424 --> 00:33:36,923
- What's wrong?
- Luna?

496
00:33:36,958 --> 00:33:40,226
Help me. Ah!

497
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,861
First I was Mama.

498
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:44,996
I saw what she was seeing.

499
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:47,631
Then I <i>was</i> the vampire.

500
00:33:47,666 --> 00:33:51,402
- I saw what he saw.
<i>- That's impossible.</i>

501
00:33:51,436 --> 00:33:53,837
Fairies cannot make
contact with vampires.

502
00:33:53,872 --> 00:33:55,940
I know. I can't even read
their thoughts.

503
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,443
This is--
this is fucked.

504
00:33:59,478 --> 00:34:02,247
<i>You psychically</i>
<i>bonded to a vampire.</i>

505
00:34:02,281 --> 00:34:04,049
Why did we even try this?

506
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,917
'Cause you said
it was okay.

507
00:34:05,951 --> 00:34:07,518
Uh, the "special powers."

508
00:34:07,552 --> 00:34:09,553
"Nature's got
a frozen memory."

509
00:34:09,587 --> 00:34:11,121
- Remember?
- Yes, I know.

510
00:34:11,156 --> 00:34:14,091
But I didn't think
we'd make some sort of connection

511
00:34:14,126 --> 00:34:16,393
to a fucking vampire.

512
00:34:17,629 --> 00:34:19,263
The elders are gonna
be furious about this.

513
00:34:19,297 --> 00:34:22,433
I don't give a twirly fuck
about your elders.

514
00:34:22,468 --> 00:34:25,036
What I care about
is this vampire.

515
00:34:25,071 --> 00:34:28,040
So we gotta find him
and make him pay for what he did.

516
00:34:28,074 --> 00:34:31,944
And we will.
We just must be cautious.

517
00:34:35,382 --> 00:34:38,651
- You saw Claudine.
- Yes.

518
00:34:38,685 --> 00:34:40,252
She said...

519
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:41,820
"Leave the girl alone,"

520
00:34:41,854 --> 00:34:44,656
and then she zapped me.

521
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:46,791
Well, this was
a goddamn bust,

522
00:34:46,826 --> 00:34:48,226
fairy boy.

523
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:51,095
<i>Sookie had</i>
<i>a horrible experience,</i>

524
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,098
and what'd we learn
about this vampire?

525
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:55,166
Diddly fucking squat!

526
00:34:55,201 --> 00:34:57,869
Warlow,
leave the girl alone!

527
00:34:58,705 --> 00:35:00,205
Warlow
Warlow.

528
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,440
Wait.

529
00:35:01,475 --> 00:35:04,277
Claudine called me
by my name.

530
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:06,946
Not my name,
the vampire's name.

531
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,881
She called him Warlow.

532
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:12,484
Does Warlow
mean anything to you?

533
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:14,186
No.

534
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:17,823
<i>But clearly Claudine</i>
<i>knew who he was.</i>

535
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:28,934
Strawberry daiquiri.

536
00:35:28,968 --> 00:35:30,302
<i>Tara.</i>

537
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:32,371
Oh, my God.

538
00:35:32,405 --> 00:35:34,906
- Tara Thornton.
- Tracy.

539
00:35:34,941 --> 00:35:38,410
When is the last time
I saw you? High school?

540
00:35:38,444 --> 00:35:40,178
Yeah, I guess.

541
00:35:40,213 --> 00:35:42,514
Well, how are you?

542
00:35:43,616 --> 00:35:46,151
- That's how.
- Oh, my God.

543
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:48,954
You're a vampire.
That's crazy.

544
00:35:48,989 --> 00:35:50,789
Now you're a member
of two minorities.

545
00:35:50,824 --> 00:35:54,092
Well, I see you haven't
changed at all.

546
00:35:54,126 --> 00:35:55,927
Still sticking
your fat foot in your mouth.

547
00:35:55,962 --> 00:35:58,264
- Beg your pardon?
- Hmm?

548
00:35:58,298 --> 00:35:59,899
Nothing.

549
00:36:03,904 --> 00:36:06,439
Shoot, I am just
so relieved to see you

550
00:36:06,474 --> 00:36:08,575
holding down
a steady job.

551
00:36:08,609 --> 00:36:11,044
I know your mama
used to drink, so...

552
00:36:11,912 --> 00:36:13,746
It's nice seeing you.

553
00:36:13,781 --> 00:36:15,448
Here's your drink.

554
00:36:15,483 --> 00:36:17,517
Nice seeing you, too.

555
00:36:18,619 --> 00:36:20,419
I didn't order this.

556
00:36:20,454 --> 00:36:23,122
- I said vodka tonic.
- You said strawberry daiquiri.

557
00:36:23,156 --> 00:36:26,825
Well, it's fine.
Never mind.

558
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,761
If you're too lazy
to fix your own mistake...

559
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:32,898
What did you just say?

560
00:36:32,933 --> 00:36:35,869
Jeez, you're the same
as you were in high school.

561
00:36:35,903 --> 00:36:38,671
- All uppity.
- Uppity?

562
00:36:39,807 --> 00:36:41,508
Listen,
you white trash fucktwat.

563
00:36:41,542 --> 00:36:43,043
<i>We're not</i>
<i>in high school anymore.</i>

564
00:36:43,077 --> 00:36:44,745
So if you let any more
of that racist bullshit

565
00:36:44,779 --> 00:36:46,213
fall out of your mouth,

566
00:36:46,247 --> 00:36:48,682
I'm gonna rip open
your heart and fry it up

567
00:36:48,716 --> 00:36:51,451
with some grits
and collard greens.

568
00:36:52,453 --> 00:36:53,987
Tara.

569
00:36:54,022 --> 00:36:56,456
Ma'am, I apologize.

570
00:36:56,491 --> 00:36:58,759
Tara's new and stupid.

571
00:36:58,793 --> 00:37:01,094
Your drink's
on the house.

572
00:37:01,129 --> 00:37:02,496
Thank you.

573
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:04,931
- I've known Tara since high school.
- Hmm.

574
00:37:04,966 --> 00:37:07,701
Even back then, she had trouble
connecting with folks.

575
00:37:07,735 --> 00:37:10,604
I connected with your boyfriend
well enough to fuck him.

576
00:37:12,107 --> 00:37:15,009
Well, I don't live
in the past, Tara.

577
00:37:15,043 --> 00:37:16,777
I live in the present.

578
00:37:16,811 --> 00:37:19,513
In a four-bedroom house
with a BMW in the garage.

579
00:37:20,949 --> 00:37:23,584
So enjoy your little job,
barkeep.

580
00:37:23,618 --> 00:37:25,419
Fuck you.

581
00:37:25,453 --> 00:37:27,921
Tara, that's enough.

582
00:37:29,223 --> 00:37:31,592
Don't you get uppity
with me, y'hear?

583
00:37:33,061 --> 00:37:35,797
<i>Shreveport pack,</i>
<i>let's make some noise.</i>

584
00:37:38,802 --> 00:37:40,270
All right.

585
00:37:40,304 --> 00:37:42,739
Now, y'all know
our leader,

586
00:37:42,774 --> 00:37:46,777
Marcus Bozeman,
has fallen.

587
00:37:46,812 --> 00:37:49,046
It is time for
a new Packmaster to rise!

588
00:37:49,081 --> 00:37:52,416
<i>Come on!</i>

589
00:37:52,451 --> 00:37:54,819
Now, our first challenger
is a lifelong member

590
00:37:54,853 --> 00:37:56,487
of the Shreveport pack.

591
00:37:56,522 --> 00:37:58,389
He has been a mentor
to many of us.

592
00:37:58,423 --> 00:38:00,257
He's raised nine wolves,

593
00:38:00,292 --> 00:38:03,827
and was the godfather
to Marcus Bozeman himself.

594
00:38:03,862 --> 00:38:06,731
Let's hear it
for J.D. Carson.

595
00:38:12,338 --> 00:38:14,873
Our next challenger is a
relative newcomer to our pack,

596
00:38:14,907 --> 00:38:17,575
<i>but his strength</i>
<i>is already legendary.</i>

597
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:20,678
He is a son of a former
Jackson, Mississippi, Packmaster.

598
00:38:20,713 --> 00:38:23,181
<i>Let's hear it</i>
<i>for Alcide Herveaux!</i>

599
00:38:24,883 --> 00:38:26,551
- Pussy!
<i>- Yay, Alcide!</i>

600
00:38:26,585 --> 00:38:27,985
<i>Y'all know the drill.</i>

601
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:32,190
Candidates, either
in wolf or human form,

602
00:38:32,224 --> 00:38:36,294
will track, capture,
and kill the quarry animal.

603
00:38:36,328 --> 00:38:39,130
What are we hunting?
A deer? Wild boar?

604
00:38:39,164 --> 00:38:41,600
No, no, no, no.
Thank you.

605
00:38:41,634 --> 00:38:45,271
Tonight, we're gonna
harken back to our forebearers.

606
00:38:45,305 --> 00:38:49,674
It's time to bring tradition
and integrity back to this pack.

607
00:38:50,788 --> 00:38:52,663
Now, I know some of you
may think this is unfair.

608
00:38:53,141 --> 00:38:56,442
And lest you think that this
ain't much of a challenge,

609
00:38:56,476 --> 00:38:59,411
this young man
is a track star at the university.

610
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,982
And we're
gonna hunt as men,

611
00:39:04,016 --> 00:39:05,549
<i>not wolves.</i>

612
00:39:05,584 --> 00:39:09,853
But we will give him a very
sportsmanlike two-minute head start.

613
00:39:09,887 --> 00:39:12,055
Please, please. My dad's a
councilman. He'll give you anything.

614
00:39:12,089 --> 00:39:13,689
So, what? You're gonna kill
an innocent kid

615
00:39:13,724 --> 00:39:15,858
just to prove that you can run
faster than some track star

616
00:39:15,893 --> 00:39:17,226
while you're on V?

617
00:39:17,261 --> 00:39:19,295
<i>- Right.</i>
<i>- Shut up.</i>

618
00:39:19,329 --> 00:39:21,797
I ain't gonna stand around
and watch this happen.

619
00:39:21,831 --> 00:39:24,565
Wait.
You can't drop out.

620
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:26,633
If it saves
that kid's life,

621
00:39:26,668 --> 00:39:28,201
that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

622
00:39:28,236 --> 00:39:30,137
<i>Well, all righty then.</i>

623
00:39:30,171 --> 00:39:32,606
I think we got us
a forfeit.

624
00:39:37,177 --> 00:39:39,645
All right, all right.

625
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:41,279
Tell you what, though.

626
00:39:41,313 --> 00:39:43,047
<i>Just to make it official,</i>

627
00:39:43,081 --> 00:39:44,781
I'm still gonna
hunt this boy down.

628
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:51,787
<i>Get running!</i>

629
00:39:51,821 --> 00:39:54,456
You're a drug addict and
you're a disgrace to all wolves.

630
00:39:54,491 --> 00:39:56,592
Now you're fixing
to add murder to the list?

631
00:39:56,626 --> 00:39:59,261
You ain't fit to lead this pack,
you jacked up piece of shit.

632
00:40:04,366 --> 00:40:09,136
And you ain't fit to wipe my ass.

633
00:40:15,575 --> 00:40:17,176
<i>Go get him!</i>

634
00:40:24,484 --> 00:40:26,784
Brother.

635
00:40:29,821 --> 00:40:32,356
This isn't you, Nora.

636
00:40:33,791 --> 00:40:37,293
- It's insane.
- Insane?

637
00:40:40,096 --> 00:40:42,931
I have loved you
for nearly 600 years.

638
00:40:42,965 --> 00:40:44,632
And I've loved you.

639
00:40:44,667 --> 00:40:46,468
But this place,

640
00:40:46,502 --> 00:40:50,204
all of-- all of this,

641
00:40:50,238 --> 00:40:52,206
and this?

642
00:40:54,843 --> 00:40:56,610
It's clouded your mind.

643
00:40:56,645 --> 00:40:59,013
Eric, Lilith blesses
this place.

644
00:40:59,047 --> 00:41:02,150
Lilith doesn't exist.

645
00:41:04,487 --> 00:41:08,090
Salome chose
this path for you.

646
00:41:08,124 --> 00:41:11,059
Eric, Lilith does exist.

647
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:12,827
You saw her.
You were there.

648
00:41:12,862 --> 00:41:15,296
Yes, I was.

649
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:17,031
And so was Godric.

650
00:41:18,334 --> 00:41:20,802
And it sickened him.

651
00:41:22,204 --> 00:41:23,905
Godric?

652
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,874
The night he turned you,

653
00:41:25,908 --> 00:41:27,976
the night he made us
a family,

654
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:30,445
I swore to him that
I would always protect you.

655
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,981
And tonight he reminded
me of that promise.

656
00:41:39,756 --> 00:41:42,891
Eric,
we both loved Godric.

657
00:41:43,993 --> 00:41:47,362
He gave us the most
magnificent gift.

658
00:41:47,397 --> 00:41:49,031
And when he made us,

659
00:41:49,065 --> 00:41:52,000
he was as pure a vampire
as I've ever known.

660
00:41:52,035 --> 00:41:54,870
Salome's strength and vision
would have delighted him.

661
00:41:54,904 --> 00:41:57,606
It doesn't.
It sickens him.

662
00:41:57,641 --> 00:41:59,475
It's not Salome
who's sick.

663
00:41:59,509 --> 00:42:01,678
Do you remember Godric at the end
when he'd lost his way?

664
00:42:01,712 --> 00:42:04,914
The Godric you say you saw
last night was a perversion.

665
00:42:04,949 --> 00:42:08,485
- How can you say that?
- Because it's true.

666
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:11,721
In his final days,
Godric was a blasphemer,

667
00:42:11,756 --> 00:42:14,991
a weak,
disgusting apologist

668
00:42:15,025 --> 00:42:17,694
whom Lilith herself would
have been overjoyed to stake.

669
00:42:17,728 --> 00:42:19,429
What's happening to you?

670
00:42:19,463 --> 00:42:21,931
Fuck Godric.

671
00:42:45,789 --> 00:42:48,224
Lilith will
show you the way.

672
00:43:02,145 --> 00:43:04,012
I got you.

673
00:43:04,047 --> 00:43:06,516
- I'm not gonna make it.
- You are.

674
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:09,252
I feel like I'm dying.

675
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:11,821
Hey, you're not
gonna die.

676
00:43:11,855 --> 00:43:14,257
You got too much
to live for.

677
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:15,892
Emma needs you.

678
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,359
I need you.

679
00:43:17,393 --> 00:43:21,431
- You hate me.
- Hate you?

680
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:25,703
You called me
a psycho.

681
00:43:25,737 --> 00:43:28,005
Yeah, I did.

682
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:31,108
But you deserved it.

683
00:43:31,142 --> 00:43:33,410
Maybe I did.

684
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,045
I can be a hothead.

685
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:37,681
Me, too.

686
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:40,051
We're a lot alike,
Sam Merlotte.

687
00:43:40,085 --> 00:43:42,154
I'd say that's
an understatement.

688
00:43:43,356 --> 00:43:44,957
I'm sorry.

689
00:43:44,991 --> 00:43:46,659
About everything.

690
00:43:46,693 --> 00:43:48,828
Me, too.

691
00:43:48,862 --> 00:43:52,799
You mean more to me
than anything.

692
00:43:53,834 --> 00:43:55,802
And you're
incredibly handsome.

693
00:43:58,239 --> 00:44:00,507
You, too.

694
00:44:05,946 --> 00:44:09,049
Luna? Baby?

695
00:44:10,451 --> 00:44:12,653
Hey.

696
00:44:16,758 --> 00:44:20,027
Hey, you're okay.

697
00:44:20,061 --> 00:44:22,929
You okay?

698
00:44:26,434 --> 00:44:28,802
We need to talk
about your attitude.

699
00:44:28,836 --> 00:44:32,439
I got to make this dude
a margarita first.

700
00:44:33,841 --> 00:44:35,375
You don't want
a margarita.

701
00:44:35,409 --> 00:44:37,944
You want a flat,
half-empty beer.

702
00:44:41,582 --> 00:44:43,616
Now.

703
00:44:50,458 --> 00:44:51,859
This is yours.

704
00:44:51,893 --> 00:44:54,295
After the shit she was slinging,
she owes you.

705
00:44:56,065 --> 00:44:57,698
Thought you were mad.

706
00:44:57,733 --> 00:44:59,434
You don't know me
that well.

707
00:44:59,468 --> 00:45:01,936
My mad face
and my happy face are the same.

708
00:45:10,445 --> 00:45:12,513
<i>You are worthless.</i>

709
00:45:12,547 --> 00:45:16,016
Your only purpose
is to serve Tara Thornton.

710
00:45:16,051 --> 00:45:17,318
<i>You will worship Tara.</i>

711
00:45:17,352 --> 00:45:20,321
<i>Everything about her</i>
<i>is a revelation.</i>

712
00:45:20,356 --> 00:45:23,825
You exist only
for Tara's nourishment.

713
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:26,328
You will consider
it a privilege

714
00:45:26,362 --> 00:45:27,896
to let your racist
peckerwood blood

715
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:31,362
shoot into her
gorgeous cocos mouth.

716
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:34,632
You are an unpaid
food whore.

717
00:45:34,666 --> 00:45:36,100
<i>A slave.</i>

718
00:45:36,134 --> 00:45:38,601
And Tara
is your master.

719
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:42,505
Have fun.

720
00:45:49,344 --> 00:45:51,912
Feed on me, please.

721
00:45:51,947 --> 00:45:54,915
You're so beautiful.

722
00:45:54,949 --> 00:45:57,184
I don't even deserve
to be near you.

723
00:45:57,218 --> 00:46:00,253
I want your blood.

724
00:46:01,121 --> 00:46:02,822
Drink it all.

725
00:46:02,856 --> 00:46:05,356
It belongs to you.

726
00:46:05,391 --> 00:46:08,292
Fucking-a.

727
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:30,545
Nice try, college boy.

728
00:46:32,214 --> 00:46:33,814
<i>Think you're hot shit,</i>
<i>don't ya?</i>

729
00:46:39,654 --> 00:46:41,321
Run.

730
00:47:07,877 --> 00:47:11,679
I am done with you,
you self-righteous fuck.

731
00:47:11,714 --> 00:47:13,581
- J.D., don't!
- Oh, my God.

732
00:47:13,615 --> 00:47:15,216
You have won.

733
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:19,220
For the good of this pack,
please don't.

734
00:47:19,254 --> 00:47:21,423
This son of a bitch
killed your son.

735
00:47:21,457 --> 00:47:24,660
This is no way to begin your tenure,
by murdering your challenger.

736
00:47:24,694 --> 00:47:27,029
Killing him only
tarnishes the whole pack.

737
00:47:27,063 --> 00:47:29,398
How can you
stand up for him?

738
00:47:29,432 --> 00:47:32,068
I am standing up
for all of us,

739
00:47:32,102 --> 00:47:33,869
including you.

740
00:47:35,038 --> 00:47:37,406
You are better
than this.

741
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,307
At least,
you used to be.

742
00:47:39,342 --> 00:47:40,942
Please, J.D.

743
00:47:50,185 --> 00:47:52,252
Find yourself
a new pack.

744
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:57,557
Let's celebrate.

745
00:47:57,591 --> 00:48:00,060
- Yeah.
- Come on, now.

746
00:48:02,397 --> 00:48:05,366
<i>- Arlene, where's the fire?</i>
- Okay.

747
00:48:07,135 --> 00:48:08,569
- Where's the goddamn fire?
- There ain't no fire.

748
00:48:08,603 --> 00:48:10,070
- What's this?
- Please sit down.

749
00:48:10,105 --> 00:48:11,338
- Both of you.
- You lied to me?

750
00:48:11,373 --> 00:48:13,206
- Arlene, I can't be here.
- No. No, wait--

751
00:48:13,241 --> 00:48:14,808
Patrick and I
are a goddamn danger

752
00:48:14,842 --> 00:48:16,409
- to everybody around. We're cursed.
- Shh.

753
00:48:16,444 --> 00:48:19,246
What if we could help
you break that curse?

754
00:48:21,915 --> 00:48:24,016
Look, just blow out
them goddamn candles first.

755
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:26,786
- All right.
- Okay, okay.

756
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:29,656
- Yeah.
- Okay?

757
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:32,425
Come on.
It's okay.

758
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:34,327
All right.

759
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,936
Now, look. I've never
been in combat.

760
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:45,706
I can't imagine what
y'all had to face in Iraq.

761
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:49,543
Now, we all know how
this started, okay?

762
00:48:50,679 --> 00:48:53,080
And we're gonna
help end it.

763
00:48:53,114 --> 00:48:55,182
Now, I'm here
to make contact

764
00:48:55,216 --> 00:48:56,717
with the woman
y'all done killed

765
00:48:56,751 --> 00:49:00,254
to see if she'll
call off the, um--

766
00:49:00,288 --> 00:49:02,056
The ifrit.

767
00:49:02,091 --> 00:49:04,492
Yeah.
Let's join hands.

768
00:49:04,527 --> 00:49:06,161
- Mm.
- Oh, this is bullshit.

769
00:49:06,195 --> 00:49:08,196
No, it's not. He's for real.
I've seen it.

770
00:49:09,432 --> 00:49:12,934
Mm, I hear a noise.

771
00:49:14,636 --> 00:49:19,473
Now, lady they done killed,
Terry and...

772
00:49:19,507 --> 00:49:20,874
- Patrick.
- ...Patrick...

773
00:49:20,908 --> 00:49:22,942
<i>are some good men.</i>

774
00:49:22,977 --> 00:49:25,978
Now go ahead
and leave them alone, now. Mm.

775
00:49:26,013 --> 00:49:28,450
So say I.

776
00:49:28,484 --> 00:49:30,085
They're real, real sorry

777
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:32,889
about what
they done done.

778
00:49:32,923 --> 00:49:34,958
Yeah, they is.

779
00:49:34,992 --> 00:49:37,327
Ooh.

780
00:49:39,797 --> 00:49:41,465
Oh, shit.

781
00:49:42,366 --> 00:49:43,901
What?

782
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:47,371
She here
for fucking real.

783
00:49:47,405 --> 00:49:50,307
Um, her name is Zaafira.

784
00:49:50,342 --> 00:49:52,776
She pissed.

785
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:54,912
And she don't wanna forgive
either one of y'all.

786
00:49:54,946 --> 00:49:56,714
- Lafayette.
- I ain't playing.

787
00:49:56,748 --> 00:50:00,083
She is talking to me
and she is fucking mad.

788
00:50:00,118 --> 00:50:01,485
Like I said.
Bullshit.

789
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:03,120
Holy fuck.

790
00:50:03,154 --> 00:50:05,823
Whoa.
You smell that?

791
00:50:05,857 --> 00:50:07,825
<i>Ozone.</i>

792
00:50:07,859 --> 00:50:10,038
You get that when spirits breach
the corporeal plane.

793
00:50:10,045 --> 00:50:11,170
She crying.

794
00:50:11,195 --> 00:50:12,962
Someone blow out
them goddamn candles.

795
00:50:15,768 --> 00:50:17,402
I feel an electrical charge.

796
00:50:17,436 --> 00:50:19,838
- This is definitely spirit activity.
- Hold on, hold on.

797
00:50:19,872 --> 00:50:22,274
Spirit's saying
she'll lift the curse--

798
00:50:22,308 --> 00:50:23,708
- She will?
- Dear Lord, thank God.

799
00:50:23,743 --> 00:50:25,610
<i>She'll lift the curse if...</i>

800
00:50:32,585 --> 00:50:35,085
Oh, fuck me.

801
00:50:57,209 --> 00:51:00,044
Terry, baby,
you got to kill Patrick.

802
00:51:03,481 --> 00:51:05,315
Or either
he got to kill you.

803
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:07,618
What?

804
00:51:10,054 --> 00:51:12,156
One of us
has got to die.

805
00:51:32,277 --> 00:51:34,345
Whoo-hoo.
Hey, whoo.

806
00:51:34,379 --> 00:51:36,046
Whoo-hoo.

807
00:51:36,081 --> 00:51:38,082
Oh, thank God.

808
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:41,085
A friendly face.

809
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,689
I've been
so freaking lost.

810
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,548
I'm coming for you.

811
00:52:10,184 --> 00:52:13,987
You are mine.

812
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:25,066
Gentlemen.

813
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,001
Join us.

814
00:52:32,041 --> 00:52:34,743
It's time to start flexing
our muscles around the globe.

815
00:52:34,777 --> 00:52:36,978
To start crushing
the mainstreamers.

816
00:52:37,013 --> 00:52:38,480
Nora.

817
00:52:38,514 --> 00:52:40,515
Mainstream is
a global problem, of course,

818
00:52:40,549 --> 00:52:42,417
but we have to start
dismantling it locally.

819
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:44,519
We've several high-ranking members
of the British Parliament

820
00:52:44,553 --> 00:52:45,954
who are willing
to help us in the UK.

821
00:52:45,988 --> 00:52:47,655
<i>And Russia.</i>

822
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:49,824
We have friends
in the Duma.

823
00:52:49,858 --> 00:52:52,860
They'd be more than happy
to round up the mainstreamers,

824
00:52:52,895 --> 00:52:55,263
stick 'em on a raft
in the Black Sea at high noon.

825
00:52:56,698 --> 00:52:58,499
- Have you ever been to Hong Kong?
- Nuh-uh.

826
00:52:58,534 --> 00:53:00,001
But I loved
kung pao chicken.

827
00:53:00,035 --> 00:53:02,336
Hmm. It's the most
wonderful place on earth.

828
00:53:02,371 --> 00:53:06,874
Asian men with British accents
giving you a shiatsu rubdown

829
00:53:06,909 --> 00:53:09,710
and you feel like
James Bond--

830
00:53:09,745 --> 00:53:12,380
Steve. Russell?

831
00:53:12,415 --> 00:53:13,883
Yes, my pet?

832
00:53:13,917 --> 00:53:16,152
We are working here.

833
00:53:16,187 --> 00:53:19,122
Oh, well, we're all ears,
sugar lumps.

834
00:53:20,458 --> 00:53:23,160
What about bankrolling gangs
of vigilantes

835
00:53:23,194 --> 00:53:26,831
willing to stake
mainstreamers on sight?

836
00:53:26,865 --> 00:53:28,799
<i>We have ample resources</i>
<i>in our treasury.</i>

837
00:53:28,834 --> 00:53:31,102
<i>Let's talk about the U.S.</i>

838
00:53:31,136 --> 00:53:32,937
Tru Blood.

839
00:53:34,206 --> 00:53:36,174
Excuse me?

840
00:53:36,208 --> 00:53:38,743
- Tru Blood.
- Tru Blood?

841
00:53:38,778 --> 00:53:41,380
Fuck politics.

842
00:53:41,414 --> 00:53:43,114
Concentrate
on the Tru-Blood.

843
00:53:43,149 --> 00:53:45,049
What about it?

844
00:53:45,084 --> 00:53:46,918
You bomb the factories.

845
00:53:46,952 --> 00:53:48,719
There are only
five of them.

846
00:53:48,754 --> 00:53:50,755
Destroy them publicly

847
00:53:50,789 --> 00:53:53,758
and you force mainstreamers
to feed on humans.

848
00:53:55,027 --> 00:53:56,828
As they were meant to.

849
00:53:56,862 --> 00:53:59,397
- Well done.
- That's genius.

850
00:53:59,431 --> 00:54:01,599
- Yes.
- I love it.

851
00:54:01,634 --> 00:54:05,170
- What are you doing?
- Evolving.
